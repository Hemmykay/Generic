## Interfaces

**Introduction**

This document explores the effective use of interfaces to define the common structure for various calendar implementations, like Google Calendar, iCal, and Outlook. By establishing a consistent interface, you ensure compatibility and flexibility while allowing for specific implementation details.

**Interfaces: Defining Object Contracts**

Interfaces in programming languages act as blueprints that specify the properties and methods that a class or object must adhere to. They describe the expected behavior but leave the implementation details to concrete classes. This provides a clear contract that enhances code maintainability and reusability.

**Why Interfaces? A Common Calendar Base**

Imagine we want to represent the concept of a calendar in our code. However, different calendar systems (e.g., Google Calendar, iCal, Outlook) have unique ways of managing events.

**Common Ground: Shared Properties and Methods**

Despite these variations, all calendars share certain fundamental functionalities, like adding and removing events. An interface can capture these shared aspects:

```typescript
interface Calendar {
  name: string; // Unique identifier for the calendar
  addEvent(event: Event): void; // Adds an event to the calendar
  removeEvent(eventId: string): void; // Removes an event by its ID
}
```

In this example, the `Calendar` interface outlines the mandatory properties (`name`) and abstract methods (`addEvent` and `removeEvent`) that any concrete calendar implementation must provide. These methods have no implementation details, allowing for flexibility in how events are added or removed.

**Concrete Implementations: Bringing Interfaces to Life**

Individual calendar systems like Google Calendar can now extend this interface and provide their specific implementations for `addEvent` and `removeEvent`:

Similarly, concrete classes for `iCalCalendar` and `OutlookCalendar` can be created with their unique implementations.
